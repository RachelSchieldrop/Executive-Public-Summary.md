## **The Flexitarian Diet - Climate Change Solution** 

As climate change is quickly advancing, finding sustainable diets is important when considering ways to reduce environmental impacts (Rayan 2020). One option for this is the flexitarian diet, which involves consuming fewer meat products and more plant products (Figure 1). This diet is beneficial for the environment, affordable, improves human health, and can be easily incorporated into everyday life (Jones et al. 2016). This summary looks at the research behind the flexitarian diet and how it could be implemented as a practical solution for tackling climate change.

### **Environmental Benefits** 

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including harmful compounds, such as carbon dioxide and methane are the main contributors to climate change (Min et al. 2022). These GHG emissions lead to temperature rises known as global warming. Livestock farming (raising cows, chickens, and other animals) significantly contributes to GHG emissions, through the release of methane during animal digestion. Additionally, livestock farming uses extensive resources such as land, water, and fertilizers (Grossi et al. 2019). Switching to a flexitarian diet, where less meat is consumed, could help limit the use of these resources and support environmentally friendly farming. 

### **Health Implications of the Flexitarian Diet** 
Meat consumed in traditional diets (omnivore diets) has been linked to an increased risk of diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer (Godfray et al. 2018). The flexitarian diet reduces the risk of these diseases as it promotes healthy plant-based alternatives which can prevent millions of deaths per year relating to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, lowering meat consumption reduces the chance of being exposed to antibiotics and pathogens often found in meat products (Godfray et al. 2018). 

### **Economic Factors** 
Many people think that the flexitarian diet is more expensive than traditional meat diets, however, research suggests that it can actually be cheaper (Pais, Marques, and Fuinhas 2022). Although plant-based imitation meats like the Beyond Meat Burger can be pricey, the flexitarian diet doesnâ€™t rely on them (Pais, Marques, and Fuinhas 2022). Instead, it promotes eating smaller amounts of real meat and focuses on affordable plant-based foods such as beans and tofu. The cost of this diet is helped by avoiding expensive imitation meats and reducing the need to buy large amounts of real meat focusing on buying affordable plant-based alternatives. 

### **Behavioural and Social Considerations**
The flexitarian diet is a balanced approach that does not demand a complete lifestyle change, making it more socially and psychologically acceptable. However, common challenges that are associated with adopting the flexitarian diet include misconceptions regarding health benefits, confidence in the diet and a lack of education surrounding sustainable diets. These challenges can be addressed by teaching the public about the importance of the flexitarian diet and in turn, can make this dietary change more appealing to individuals (Sijtsema et al. 2021).     

### **Limitations and Areas for Future Research** 
Despite the benefits associated with the flexitarian diet, several limitations to its implementation must be considered in future research. These limitations involve incorporating animal by-products such as milk, eggs and honey into the flexitarian diet; considering product packaging and its environmental impact; exploring the role of cultured meat in the flexitarian diet; and considering the impact of this diet on farmers.  

In conclusion, the flexitarian diet acts as a promising solution to climate change addressing the environmental, health and economic feasibility of its implementation from a human behaviour perspective.
